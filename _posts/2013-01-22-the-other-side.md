The past few months have not been easy, and I'm being fairly honest. Let's simply not get into the gory details.

I'm posting this as a thumbs-up to my awesome girl, Kiranmai, who I'm pretty sure is the reason I get up every morning with a purpose in mind.
The purpose is simple - keeping her happy and smiling always.
If it wasn't for her, I'm sure things would have been different if not worse.
She cares for me, helps me through my troubles, and always keeps me smiling. Here's to her.

    <div class="poemline">Bright Star, would I were stedfast as thou art</div>
    <div class="poemline">Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night</div>
    <div class="poemline">And watching, with eternal lids apart,    </div>
    <div class="poemline">Like nature's patient, sleepless Eremite, </div>
    <div class="poemline">The moving waters at their priestlike task</div>
    <div class="poemline">Of pure ablution round earth's human shores</div>
    <div class="poemline">Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask     </div>
    <div class="poemline">Of snow upon the mountains and the moors  </div>
    <div class="poemline">No - yet still stedfast, still unchangeable</div>
    <div class="poemline">Pillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast</div>
    <div class="poemline">To feel for ever its soft fall and swell, </div>
    <div class="poemline">Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,	    </div>
    <div class="poemline">Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath</div>
    <div class="poemline">And so live ever - or else swoon to death.</div>
    <div class="poemnote">Bright Star, John Keats</div>
